# SAP Cloud for Energy Sample API Requests

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-for-energy-api-samples)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-for-energy-api-samples)

## Description
You have a valid *SAP Cloud for Energy* license and want to get familiar with the *Energy Data Services* API? Then the User Guide in this repository in combination with the sample request messages for the *Energy Data Services* API endpoints that we offer for download are a great resource for you.

*SAP Cloud for Energy* is a cloud application for storing and managing energy and water measurement data. This data is collected by smart meters that are installed in the homes of the utility’s customers. Measurement data and related device master data are ingested and can be retrieved using the *Energy Data Services* API. Many business processes rely on the data managed with *SAP Cloud for Energy*.
For more information about *SAP Cloud for Energy*, refer to the User Assistance on the [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_Cloud_for_Energy). 
Most information there is only accessible to SAP customers with support user ID (S-User ID).

The *Energy Data Services* API is published with the *SAP Cloud for Energy* API package on the [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPC4EEDSAPIs/overview).
The API’s basic concepts, the endpoints, the structure of the request messages, as well as the validations and replacement value procedures carried out during the ingestion process are described in the [Energy Data Services API Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_Cloud_for_Energy/960d94470c744a1fa72121ac63fa9d04/3077eb89ea66478c941246afb2b4192c.html?version=CLOUD). 
To access the information, you need a support user ID (S-User ID).

This offering on SAP Samples is a supplement to the product documentation available on the SAP Help Portal. The product documentation in combination with the User Guide and the sample request messages in this repository will enable you to successfully use the *Energy Data Services* API and *SAP Cloud for Energy*.
